- **Libraries:** pandas, SQL (via pandasql), seaborn
- **Data:** Structured resume dataset
- **Output:** Visual and statistical analysis

## Highlights

- Analyzed education and career paths across roles
- Identified law graduates who transitioned into IT fields
- Compared degree types and seniority distributions
- Produced visual breakdowns of tech vs. non-tech paths

## Pipeline

1. Import dataset and clean anomalies
2. Run exploratory SQL queries with pandasql
3. Merge role, degree, and experience dimensions
4. Visualize using seaborn (distributions, correlations)

## Insights

- Legal professionals entering tech skew toward data and backend roles
- Postgraduate degrees correlate with faster transition into mid-level positions
- Junior developers often come from diverse prior industries

## Testing

- Sanity checks on joins and null handling
- Unit tests for custom cleaning functions

## Results
